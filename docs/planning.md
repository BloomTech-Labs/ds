# Planning

## Plot your progress

Track your team's progress like [how the EFF tracks AI research progress](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics) â€” with time on the x-axis, an evaluation metric on the y-axis, and a datapoint for each attempt, compared to some baseline:

We care less about the end result (how high the metric goes at the end of the project) and more about the effort rate (how many attempts are made to iterate early). Your line's slope measures your learning rate.
